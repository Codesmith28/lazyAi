LazyAI is a Go TUI (Terminal User Interface) application that brings AI assistance right to your clipboard. It features a dashboard to manage history, AI model, and prompts. Users can simply copy text, and LazyAI automatically sends it to the AI, generates a response, and copies it to the clipboard for easy pasting.
